Apparently at some point I realized that I was going to be doing this "code thing" for the foreseeable future. As such I thought I should operate on the assumption that I'm going to continue to want to get better at it as well as want to continue recording/sharing what I know. To that end, instead of always saying I'm going to start writing more blog posts and working on more open-source, I'm just going to actually, you know, do it.
